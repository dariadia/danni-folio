## Hi 🧤 
### I'm Danni, and this is my website portfolio.

### So, what's a folio...? 🐲

🟢 folio /ˈfəʊlɪəʊ/

✅ an individual leaf of paper or parchment, either loose as one of a series or forming part of a bound volume, which is numbered on the recto or front side only.
✅ a sheet of paper folded once to form two leaves (four pages) of a book.

Thus, my portfolio design is inspired by the two things I love:
  - 📗 books
  - 💚 code
  - 🍀 also, you might've already guessed that _green_ is my favourite colour

## What's in

In tech terms, it's a web page built with
- 🧩 [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) 
- 🧩 [styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
- 🧩 employing [Danni's design system](https://github.com/dariadia/danni-s-design-system) – yeah, a package devoloped by me 🧪
